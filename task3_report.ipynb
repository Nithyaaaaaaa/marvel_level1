    "## Description of the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this task is to **clean and preprocess a raw, real-world dataset** using the\n",
    "**Pandas library** in Python so that it becomes suitable for data analysis and machine learning\n",
    "applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world datasets are often messy and contain issues such as missing values, inconsistent\n",
    "formatting, incorrect data types, and duplicate records. If these issues are not handled\n",
    "properly, they can negatively impact the accuracy and reliability of analysis and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the task involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading and inspecting a raw dataset to identify data quality issues  \n",
    "- Handling missing values using appropriate strategies  \n",
    "- Fixing inconsistencies in categorical and text-based columns  \n",
    "- Converting columns into correct data types such as numeric and datetime  \n",
    "- Removing duplicate records  \n",
    "- Saving the cleaned dataset as a new CSV file  \n",
    "\n",
    "This task highlights the importance of **data cleaning as the foundation of any data-driven\n",
    "workflow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Data Cleaning (Data Detox)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning, also known as **data detox**, refers to the process of identifying and correcting\n",
    "errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common data quality problems include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing or null values  \n",
    "- Inconsistent text formatting (e.g., “Male”, “male”, “ MALE ”)  \n",
    "- Incorrect data types (dates stored as strings, numbers stored as text)  \n",
    "- Duplicate rows  \n",
    "- Invalid or corrupted entries  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides a rich set of functions to inspect, clean, and transform data, making it an\n",
    "essential tool for preprocessing tasks in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Used\n",
    "\n",
    "A customer-related dataset was used for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of records:** Approximately 50,000  \n",
    "- **Number of columns:** 10  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Columns in the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- CustomerID  \n",
    "- Name  \n",
    "- Age  \n",
    "- Gender  \n",
    "- Country  \n",
    "- SignupDate  \n",
    "- LastLogin  \n",
    "- TotalPurchase  \n",
    "- PreferredDevice  \n",
    "- Email  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains missing values in both numeric and categorical columns  \n",
    "- Includes inconsistent text formatting  \n",
    "- Date columns are initially stored as strings  \n",
    "- May contain duplicate records  \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset closely resembles real-world business data, making it suitable for practicing\n",
    "practical data cleaning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach Followed to Solve the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Inspection and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was loaded using Pandas and explored using functions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- .head() to view sample rows  \n",
    "- .info() to inspect column data types and non-null counts  \n",
    "- .isnull().sum() to identify missing values  \n",
    "\n",
    "A backup copy of the raw dataset was created before applying any transformations to ensure\n",
    "data safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Handling Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values were handled carefully based on the nature of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age:** Filled using the **median**, as age data may contain outliers  \n",
    "- **Gender and Country:** Filled using the **mode** (most frequent value), suitable for\n",
    "  categorical data  \n",
    "- **TotalPurchase:** Filled using the **mean**, appropriate for continuous numerical data  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach prevents unnecessary data loss while maintaining statistical validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Fixing Text and Categorical Inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure consistency in categorical data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leading and trailing whitespaces were removed  \n",
    "- Text was converted to a uniform format:\n",
    "  - Gender → lowercase  \n",
    "  - Country → title case  \n",
    "  - PreferredDevice → lowercase  \n",
    "\n",
    "These steps ensure that logically identical categories are treated as the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Correcting Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct data types are essential for meaningful analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Date columns (SignupDate, LastLogin) were converted to datetime format  \n",
    "- Invalid date entries were handled safely using coercion  \n",
    "- Age was converted to integer type  \n",
    "- TotalPurchase was converted to float type  \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows accurate numerical and time-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Removing Duplicate Records\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicate rows can lead to biased analysis and incorrect insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset was checked for duplicate records  \n",
    "- All duplicate rows were removed to ensure data integrity  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that each record represents a unique customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Final Validation and Saving the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning, the dataset was validated to confirm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correct data types  \n",
    "- No unintended missing values  \n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned dataset was then saved as a new CSV file, while the raw dataset remained unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcomes and Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this task, I gained practical experience in **cleaning real-world datasets using Pandas**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key learnings include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The importance of inspecting data before cleaning  \n",
    "- Choosing appropriate strategies for handling missing values  \n",
    "- Maintaining consistency in categorical data  \n",
    "- Preserving raw data through backups  "
